A polyfill in JavaScript is a piece of code or a JavaScript library that provides modern functionality for web developers in older web browsers that do not support those features natively. It "fills in" the gaps or polyfills the missing features, allowing developers to write code using the latest web standards while ensuring compatibility with older browsers. Polyfills typically detect if a feature is unsupported in the user's browser and provide a substitute implementation to make the code work as expected. They are essential tools for creating cross-browser-compatible web applications.
